# PokemonPopulationGrowth

Overview
-
For the Pokémon population growth simulation, I analyze the growth of a base population of a certain number of Pokémon within the species over a certain amount of time, considering the number of egg cycles and gender ratio. 


Pokémon Class 
-
For every Pokémon, the simulation takes into consideration its name, gender, and egg group. 


Egg Class 
-
An egg is categorized by the species of the Pokémon is hatches into, using its species name. It keeps track of its current cycle.


Gender Definition 
-
Every Pokémon within the population will have a probability of being male or female based on the gender rate. Each Pokémon born will also have this chance.


Time 
-
Time will be measured using cycles as the unit. This is because throughout the games, 1 egg cycle is the same number of steps as how long it takes the egg breeder to check for an egg. This is to say that Pokémon will also be spawned with the chance to have certain abilities.


Breeding 
-
Breeding will take place between one male and one female of the species. Each female in a population checks if there is a male with whom to try breeding. If successful, the female will carry the egg until it is ready to hatch. This is because there is no trainer to help the egg hatch. Ergo, there needs to be a party to incubate the egg.  

Spreadsheet 
-
The program's output will go on an Excel spreadsheet so we can visualize the population growth
